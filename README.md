The k-map solver is simply a web-based tool to solve (currently) 3 variable and 4 variable K-maps.

You need to have a JavaScript enables browser to run the same.

Just input the expression which you require to be solved and the web tool will perform and provide the output along with the number of gates required
to realize the same. 

(The tool currently runs calculations only for 3-varible and 4-varible expressions.)
